# How to find Duplicates Using Hashing

This is a tutorial on how to find duplicates using different hashing techniques in Python

# Quickstart

To get started with this tutorial, you'll want to use the [`jupyter/base-notebook`](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/base-notebook) image.

To get started, we'll want to run:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/minimal-notebook
```

If you haven't already run the `minimal-notebook` docker image before, docker will automatically download the image and
start a container based on the image.  Once it's downloaded, you'll use the URL provided in the terminal output to access
the Jupyter server.
